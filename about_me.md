Hello! My name is Yleona Marie Q. Abrera and I am a 9th grade student in Ateneo de Naga Junior Highschool. I am 14 years old and my birthday is on September 29. I'm a female and a proud bisexual. Born and raised in the Philippines by my beautiful mama and my awesome papa. I also have 2 siblings a younger and older brother. My favourite things to do when i'm bored is that I love drawing. Not just digitaly but sketching traditionaly as well.
